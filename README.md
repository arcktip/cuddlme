# READ ME: Cuddl.Me  
Making Fetch Happen Since 2013.

### What It Is

Cuddl.Me is a web app that lets dog owners join play dates for their furry friends in parks around New York City. 

It is also an opportunity for users to explore the many parks/off-leash spaces in New York City based on distance and user favorites. 

### How I Made It

This full rails app uses geolocational data from the GeoCoder API and open source data from <https://nycopendata.socrata.com/> to create a social network where members can set up dates for their dogs based on gender, age, breed and favorite parks.

It is my first project as part of the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly.
